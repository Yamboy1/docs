# Installation

To initialize and publish your first module to nest.land, you will need our CLI, **eggs**. You can install it using this command:
```shell script
deno install -A -f --unstable -n eggs https://x.nest.land/eggs@0.1.8/mod.ts
```

Please make sure to use the `-A` flag to grant all permissions to eggs, so you can enjoy all features seamlessly.

> Note: You need to upgrade to Deno v1.1.0 or newer in order to use our CLI.
