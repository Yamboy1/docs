# Introduction

Welcome to [nest.land](https://nest.land)!

Nest.land is a first-of-its-kind decentralized module registry and CDN built for [Deno](https://deno.land).

## How does it work?

Using the power of blockchain, you can publish your Deno modules to the [Arweave Permaweb](https://www.arweave.org/) through nest.land, where they can **never** be deleted. With this feature, you can make sure that your users will always have the required resources for their projects, via Deno's web-based module imports. 

## What are the benefits of nest.land?
[nest.land](https://nest.land) has many benefits over hosting your packages on [Github](https://github.com) / [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x). Let's go over the most important ones.

### Permanently immutable
Your files will **never** change and will **never** be deleted. The [Arweave Permaweb](https://www.arweave.org/) is a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets, and allows us to record and store your Typescript / Javascript code, and it's history indefinitely.
You can read more about Arweave [here](https://www.arweave.org/#arweave-intro).
                                                                                                                 
### Secure and open source
We never track usage / user data. [nest.land](https://nest.land)'s open source code allows developers to safely use our site, knowing that they can trust us anytime.

### Works without Git
[nest.land](https://nest.land) is independent of git, or other version control systems, allowing you to publish a Deno package with only some code on your local machine.

### Maintains the Deno philosophy
[nest.land](https://nest.land) changes nothing in you Deno workflow. You still use url imports, just more secure ones.
