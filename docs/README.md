# Introduction

Welcome to [nest.land](https://nest.land)!

Nest.land is a first-of-its-kind decentralized module registry and CDN built for [Deno](https://deno.land).

## How does it work?

Using the power of blockchain, you can publish your Deno modules to the [Arweave Permaweb](https://www.arweave.org/) through nest.land, where they can **never** be deleted or modified. With this feature, you can make sure that your users will always have the required module files for their projects, via Deno's web-based module imports. 

## What are the benefits of nest.land?
[nest.land](https://nest.land) has many benefits over hosting your modules on [Github](https://github.com), [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x), or on your own webserver. Let's go over some notable ones!

### Permanently immutable
Your files can **never** change and will **never** be deleted. The [Arweave Permaweb](https://www.arweave.org/) is a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets, and allows us to record and store your module code indefinitely.
You can read more about Arweave [here](https://www.arweave.org/#arweave-intro).
                                                                                                                 
### Secure and open source
Thanks to the blockchain, you never have to worry about a security breach that causes your modules to break. We don't even need to ask for user emails! In addition, [nest.land](https://nest.land)'s open source code allows developers to see exactly what goes on behind the scenes, while knowing that they can trust us with their module data.
You can find our source code [here](https://github.com/nestdotland).

### Works without Git
[nest.land](https://nest.land) works independently of git, or any other version control systems for that matter, allowing you to publish a Deno module with only some code on your local machine.

### Maintains the Deno philosophy
1. Module code functions without a `package.json` or equivalent configuration file.
2. Your code is served from a truly decentralized network of computers from around the world.
3. You don't need to vendor your modules!
