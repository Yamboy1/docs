# Publishing a module

To publish a module, just navigate to the root of your module and use the command shown:
```shell script
eggs publish
```
Boom! After this, you'll be returned a link to your module on our [Gallery](gallery). You can also update your `README.md` with this url, in case you use it in examples.

> Note: The same command is used to publish a new version to an existing module!

## Badge

In addition, you'll have the option of adding our official badge to your project docs, courtesy of [@maximousblk](https://github.com/maximousblk). This is the best way you can support our registry and help us grow. We'd really appreciate seeing it on your project!
