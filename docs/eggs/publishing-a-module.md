# Publishing a module

To publish a module, just navigate to the root of your module (where your egg file is located) and use the command shown:
```shell script
eggs publish
```
**Boom!** After this, you'll be returned a link to your module on our [Gallery](https://nest.land/gallery). You should also update your `README.md` with this url so that other users can find your module on [nest.land](https://nest.land)!

> Note: Use the same command to publish a new version to an existing module!
