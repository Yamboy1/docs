# Linking your API key

In order to publish modules to the blockchain with our CLI, you must first generate an API key. See [Getting Started](https://nest.land/#start).

After you generate your API key, you need to add it in the CLI. To do this, type:
```shell script
eggs link --key [your key]
```

This will save your API key on your local machine. Now you will be able to publish modules to the blockchain without logging in ever again.

> Do **not** share your API key with anyone. 
>
> If you want others to be able to publish a new version to your package, just wait, we are already working on it.
